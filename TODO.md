# To-do & ideas list

## General

- calculate and show extrema for element values (`M_y(x)` etc.)
- analytical analysis for elements (`M_y(x)` etc.)
- make structural dynamics solver work again

## UX
- zoom using touch is much less performant than mousewheel, slow perf in Firefox
- need a way to validate structure before solve or handle solve errors (e.g., unstable structure, supported nodes not connected to the structure)

## Errors

- `SVGViewer` sometimes throws errors (NaNs in transformations and position)
- Warnings in add node dialog
