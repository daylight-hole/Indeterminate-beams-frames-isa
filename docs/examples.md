## Simply supported beam

A simply supported beam is a fundamental structural element commonly used in civil engineering and construction. It consists of a horizontal member that is supported at both ends, allowing it to freely rotate and deflect under applied loads. The term "simply supported" refers to the beam's support conditions, which are typically characterized by pinned or roller supports at each end.

## Cantilever

A simple cantilever is a structural element supported at one end, with the other end left free. It extends horizontally (or vertically) from its support point, bearing loads applied at its free end.
